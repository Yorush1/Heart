                <h1>Dear Shen.</h1>
                <p>I want to convey my feelings for you using this letter.</p>
                <p>I want to tell you how it started.
                <p>It started when naging magkagroup tayo. When you approached me about our acting and talked to me, your voice really soothed me and calmed me for some reason.</p>
                <p>When the groupings ended i was kinda sad because i can't find the reason to talk to you anymore, and im kind of a socially awkward person so i found it really hard to approach you and have a normal talk with you.</p>
                <p>And eventually i started catching my self always looking at you. I started to question myself on why im looking at you, and for some reason a thought came across my mind saying "Do i like her?"
                I rejected that thought and tried to focus on my school works, but that thought never exited my mind. I was scared, im not gonna lie. Because i never wanted to fall in love again after getting rejected so many times.
                And around half a month ago i opened up to arlan and marion about it. They told me that i was in love, well i was shocked that they said that. And scared at the same time, because falling in love with someone is really hard for me because of my looks and insecurities, and i didn't have the energy to fall inlove again. They told me it was so obvious that i was inlove, but i kept rejecting them saying "Pre 'di ako inlove".
                And one day may naalala ako about sa groupings so oral com, wala naman ako ibang mapagtanungan about it because busy sila marion, so i mustered up the courage to ask you about it.</p>
                <p>And eventually kinulit kita about it, haha sorry for annoying you. But im glad i chatted you that day, because otherwise i wouldn't be madly in love right now.
                I never actually thought na i would be in love right now, because i prayed to god about it. To let me give up on love because at that time i can't really find any girl that would love me for who i am and accept everything about me, other than my mom.
                But now here i am, madly in love with you. The thing that really shocked me was that one night i found myself praying to god for you to be the one. I want you to be the one to spend enternity with me together, to be with me on highs and lows.
                I want to keep supporting you on whatever you do and be there for you no matter what. I'll fight for our love. I never want love another woman, unless it's you. Because of you, i started to believe in love again, because of you my days become brighter than even. And everything seem's more fun than even with you.
                Everytime i get to see you, i get so excited that my heart could burst just by looking at you.</p>
                <p>I find it really hard to pin point the reason on why i love you. So i prayed to god about it. And he gave me an answer.
                I love you because you are you, you are special to me. No other woman or person can replace you, the love i feel for you is something so special that i can't explain it with just mere words.
                I want to show my love for you with not just words, but with actions. I want to make you feel special, because you are special. I want to show you how important you are to me and i want to pursue you no matter what. So please shen, let me show how much i love you and how very important you are to me. I know im kinda awkward sa personal but i'll do my best not to be.
                I want to ask you something, i know you have strict parents but im willing to meet with you parents. Shen would you love to go out with me?
                I know in order to go on dates with you i would have to ask you parents for permission. And i don't mind, yes im scared but im willing to face my fears in order to be with you. I want to learn more about you, i want to know the things you love and hate. I want to go on dates with you. And after some time i would like to meet with your parents again. Why? i want to ask them permission to let me court you.
                Shen im serious about this. I have never felt anything like this before, and i don't want to let it go to waste. I'm willing to change for you. I want us to grow together. I'm willing to communicate like adults in order to fix any issues. I will always be by your side no matter what. I love you shen.</p>
                <p>Forever yours,<br>Yvan.</p>
